/**
 * The two ends of the mini-to-full morph, recorded rather than drawn.
 *
 * The morph Melox does -- and the one this now does -- is NOT a sheet sliding up over a
 * mini player. Both ends are recorded into a [GraphicsLayer] and neither is drawn where
 * it lives. One overlay, sized to the interpolated container rect, draws the mini
 * player's recording at its own local offsets while it fades, and the WHOLE full player
 * recording scaled down into the same rect. That is why the player appears to shrink into
 * the pill and unfold back out of it, instead of one panel travelling past another.
 *
 * Module-level for the same reason the rects are: the pill lives in the floating nav bar,
 * the sheet lives in the player, the overlay is drawn in between, and none of the three
 * can hand a value to the other two through the tree.
 *
 * Plain fields, not snapshot state -- everything here is read in the DRAW phase, and a
 * snapshot read there would make every write re-invalidate the frame (the trap that
 * `hideWhileArtworkMorphing` was fixed for).
