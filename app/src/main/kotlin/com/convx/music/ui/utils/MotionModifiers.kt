/**
 * Everything a hero screen needs for pull-to-zoom, so each one is two lines
 * instead of five: pass [scale] to `HeroBackground(heroScale = …)` and
 * [Modifier.heroPullZoom] to its list.
 *
 * [rawPull] is the distance the FINGER has travelled past the top edge; [offset]
 * is how far the content is actually allowed to move, which is [rubberBand] of
 * that. Keeping the two apart is the whole point: the previous version stored the
 * damped value and damped it *again* on each delta with
 * `resistance = (1 - pull/maxPull) * 0.5`, so the content moved at HALF finger
 * speed from the very first pixel and then hit a hard clamp at maxPull. Starting
 * at half speed is what made the pull feel cheap and disconnected — iOS tracks the
 * finger 1:1 at the start and only stiffens as you go, which is exactly what the
 * rubber band curve does.
 *
 * Both are plain [MutableFloatState]s rather than an
 * [androidx.compose.animation.core.Animatable] mutated via `scope.launch { snapTo(...) }`
 * on every scroll delta — that pattern let a fast drag queue up dozens of
 * coroutines racing each other (same bug class as the app's overscroll had),
 * and the zoom could get stuck mid-scale when one of them applied a stale
 * value after a newer one. Scroll-time updates are now a direct synchronous
 * write; a coroutine (and a real spring) is only used once, on release.
