/**
 * Tracks a looping video's playback position as a plain (non-snapshot-state)
 * clock, so glass surfaces sampling its backdrop can compute a bucket for
 * `Modifier.liquidGlass`'s `loopBucket` (via `LocalBackdropLoopBucket`)
 * without the draw-phase snapshot-read trap documented at
 * `BackdropFreeze.kt:21-23` and `MainActivity.kt:1260-1264` — a snapshot read
 * during the draw phase registers a draw dependency, and every write then
 * re-invalidates the frame forever.
 *
 * [update] is meant to be called periodically (see `BackgroundVideoView`)
 * rather than on every position change, since the bucket width is coarser
 * than a video frame anyway.
