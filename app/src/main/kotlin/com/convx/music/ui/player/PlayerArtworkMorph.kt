 *
 * Sized to the FULL (target) rect, not the mini one -- scaling DOWN from there to the
 * mini size at fraction 0, then back up to 1:1 (its native size) at the handoff. This
 * is the opposite of the first version, which sized to the small mini rect and scaled
 * UP: scaling up stretches whatever resolution the underlying image happens to be,
 * which read as soft mid-growth even after requesting a larger decode, because the
 * COMPOSE LAYOUT SIZE (what a bitmap gets stretched across) was still the tiny mini
 * box the whole time. Sizing to full and scaling down means the on-screen image is
 * never asked to be bigger than the pixels it actually has -- downsampling stays
 * sharp at any fraction, which is exactly the technique Melox's own
 * `PlayerSheetArtworkOverlay` uses (see the scratchpad clone read for this fix).
 *
 * `transformOrigin` pinned to the top-left (not the layer's default center) so a
 * plain `translationX/Y = rect.left/top` places the SCALED result exactly at
 * [sharedArtworkRect]'s interpolated rect, with no extra center-offset math needed.
 *
 * A fresh [AsyncImage] of the same URL, not a captured GraphicsLayer of the mini
 * player's own rendering (Melox's technique) -- both artworks show identical content,
 * so a pixel capture buys nothing a positioned image doesn't, and Coil's cache is
 * already warm from the mini player's own load.
 *
 Its corner radius travels with it, from the pill cover's to whatever the player's own
 * artwork uses (a card's radius, or half its size for the round vinyl), so the cover
 * grows into the real shape instead of snapping to a circle on the way.
