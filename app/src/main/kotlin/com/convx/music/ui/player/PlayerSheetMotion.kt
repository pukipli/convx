/*
 * Geometry for a mini-player <-> full-player transition treated as a shared element:
 * one container and one artwork travelling between two measured rects, rather than a
 * sheet sliding up over the top of a separate mini player.
 *
 * The reason this reads better than a straight interpolation is that nothing here moves
 * on a single curve — each axis of each element gets its own, and the
 * asymmetry is the whole effect:
 *
 * - The container's **height** tracks progress linearly while its **width** runs on
 *   [easeInCubic]. The sheet therefore grows tall first and only flares out to full width
 *   near the end, which is what makes it look like it is rising out of the bar instead of
 *   inflating in place.
 * - The artwork's **x** runs on [easeOutCubic] — it commits to its horizontal position
 *   early, so the cover appears to lead the motion — while its **y** is a blend of
 *   [easeInCubic] and linear ([ARTWORK_VERTICAL_LINEAR_WEIGHT]), keeping vertical travel
 *   closer to the finger during a drag.
 *
 * All of this is pure geometry: no Compose state, no animation. Feed it a progress value
 * from whatever already drives the sheet (a drag, a spring) and it returns where things
 * belong at that instant. Kept separate from the sheet itself so the curves can be
 * checked directly, which is the only practical way to verify motion this fiddly.
