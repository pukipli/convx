 * The one surface the whole morph happens inside.

 * Positioned at the interpolated container rect -- the pill's bounds at progress 0, the
 * whole screen at 1 -- it draws BOTH recordings:
 *
 * - the mini player's, at the container's own top-left, fading out over the first
 *   quarter, so its cover/title/buttons keep their offsets from the container's top edge
 *   while that edge travels;
 * - the full player's, scaled by `container width / full width`, so the entire player UI
 *   shrinks into the pill and unfolds back out of it.
 *
 * That second half is what a translating sheet cannot do, and the reason the old version
 * read as "the bar rises while the player drops" rather than as one thing folding into
 * another.
 *
 * ENTIRELY draw-phase. An earlier version sized a real Box from progress read in
 * composition; it composed once, at progress 0.0004, and never again -- so the container
 * sat at pill size for the whole gesture while the sheet it had replaced was no longer
 * drawing itself either. Reading progress here means the frame that changes it is the
 * frame that redraws this, with no recomposition at all.
