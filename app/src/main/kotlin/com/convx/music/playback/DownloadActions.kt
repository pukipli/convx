/*
 * One place that decides which songs a bulk download action actually touches.
 *
 * Every screen used to inline `songs.forEach { sendAddDownload(...) }` and
 * `songs.forEach { sendRemoveDownload(...) }` over the whole list, with no regard for what
 * state each download was already in. Two user-visible bugs fell out of that, and because
 * the loop was copy-pasted into sixteen files both bugs existed sixteen times:
 *
 * - Tapping the "Downloading" row to cancel removed *every* download in the list,
 *   including the ones that had already finished, deleting files the user had waited for.
 * - Tapping download again after a network drop re-queued the whole list, because
 *   `DownloadManager.addDownload` moves even a COMPLETED download back to QUEUED, so the
 *   already-downloaded songs were fetched a second time.
 *
 * The filtering predicates below are pure and unit-tested; the send* wrappers are the thin
 * Android-facing shell around them.
