 * Lightweight typo-tolerant match: every character of [query] must appear in [target], in
 * order, case-insensitively — gaps allowed. Returns null when [query] isn't a subsequence of
 * [target] at all; otherwise a score where higher means a tighter, more contiguous, earlier
 * match, so callers can `sortedByDescending` a filtered list.
 *
 * Not a database-level fuzzy index (no FTS migration) — just an in-memory fallback for local
 * libraries small enough to fully scan, used when the exact substring search finds nothing.
