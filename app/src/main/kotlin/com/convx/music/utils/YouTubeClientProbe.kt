/**
 * Asks every InnerTube client, one at a time, whether it can still produce a playable
 * stream — and says which ones did.
 *
 * Which clients YouTube honours is a moving target: they are fingerprints, and YouTube
 * silently starts rejecting them. When playback breaks for a lot of people at once the
 * question is never "is our fallback chain correct" (it is) but "which of these eleven
 * still work today", and that cannot be answered by reading source. It needs a real
 * request against a real videoId from a real device on a real network — which is also why
 * this lives in the app rather than in a unit test: the answer depends on the user's IP,
 * their login state and their region, and it differs between them.
 *
 * Diagnostic only. Nothing calls this during playback; it is driven from the debug screen
 * so a user reporting "nothing plays" can produce a result worth acting on instead of a
 * guess.
